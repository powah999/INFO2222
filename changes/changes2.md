authentication works
xss prevention

uh decrypting and encrypting works but the library sucks so we're switching

message history has not been touched yet

still thinking whether or not to store keys in localstorage or sessions, but since we get extension im more free to implement latter

1. history not added
2. need to set up socket_rouotes.py connect
3. decrypt encrypt functions
4. private key in session?
5. requests with sockets
